   VIA  -- Volumetric Image Analysis
   

VIA is an image processing package.
It contains about 70 library functions and 50
application programs.

The data format, file-handling routines,
as well as some image processing routines
are taken from the public-domain-package "Vista"
(www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/lci/vista/vista/html).

To compile VIA do the following:
(These are instructions to do an out-of-source build
with the cmake tool. For further information consult the

www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html)

1. create a directory 'build' with 'mkdir build'

2. chdir to the new directory with 'cd build'

3. type cmake ../

4. type 'make'

5. type 'make install'

6. optionally, type 'make clean'
