vop - perform arithmetic and logical operations on images.
<p>
<dl compact><dt><b>
Description</b><dd>
vop performs arithmetic and logical operations on image pixels. It has three modes: </dl>
<p>
 1. It can perform a unary (single-operand) operation on each pixel of an input image. 
<p>
 2. It can perform a binary (two-operand) operation between each pixel of an input image and a scalar value. 
<p>
 3. It can perform a binary (two-operand) operation between each pixel of an input image and the corresponding pixel of a second image. The mode, operation, and operands are specified by command line options. Input images come from a data file; the specified operation is performed on each to pro­ duce an output image of the same properties. 
<p>
 When the operation is a binary one between two images (case 3, above), the second input comes from a separate file, and it may have the same number of bands as the first input image, in which case band i of the output image is formed from band i of both input image; or formed from band i of the first input image and band 0 of the second. 
<p>
 By means of the -min and -max options, you can specify bounds for clipping output pixel values. 
<p>
 When -op specifies a binary operation, either -image or -value must be specified. The and, or, and xor operations can only be performed with images having integer pixel representations (not float or double). A floating point result (such as what exp produces) is rounded to the nearest inte­ ger for storing in an integer output pixel. Clipping of output pixel values and arithmetic exceptions are reported by means of warning messages.<dl compact><dt><b>

 <code>vop</code></dl><dl compact><dt><b>
Parameters: </b><dd>
<table border=0 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td valign=top><em>-in</em>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specifies a Vista data file containing the input images. These images serve as the first operand of a binary operation, or the only operand of a unary one. </td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><em>-out</em>&nbsp;</td><td>
output image</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><em>-op</em>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specifies the operation. Possible values: abs,exp,log,not,sqrt,square,add,and,dist,div,max,min,mult,or,sub,xor</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><em>-value</em>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specifies a scalar constant to be used as the second operand  of a binary operation. </td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><em>-image</em>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specifies a Vista data file containing a single image to serve as the second operand of a binary operation. </td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><em>-min</em>&nbsp;</td><td>
Sets a lower bound for clipping output pixel values. Default: the minimum value that can be represented by an output pixel.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><em>-max</em>&nbsp;</td><td>
Sets an upper bound for clipping output pixel values. Default: the maximum value that can be represented by an output pixel.</td></tr>
